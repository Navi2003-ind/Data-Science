        "\n",
        "# 1. Preventing Program Crashes:\n",
        "#    - When an exception occurs in a thread or process, it can cause the entire program to crash if not handled properly.\n",
        "#    - Exception handling ensures that the program continues to run even if one part encounters an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Maintaining Data Integrity:\n",
        "#    -  Exceptions can disrupt shared resources and lead to data corruption.\n",
        "#    - Proper exception handling helps maintain data consistency and prevent unexpected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Graceful Degradation:\n",
        "#    -  By handling exceptions, you can gracefully degrade the program's performance instead of abruptly halting it.\n",
        "#    - This allows the program to continue operating even if some parts fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Debugging and Monitoring:\n",
        "#    -  Exception handling provides a mechanism to log errors, track down the source of problems, and monitor the program's health.\n",

        "# Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. try-except Blocks:\n",
        "#    -  The most basic approach is to use try-except blocks to catch exceptions within threads or processes.\n",
        "#    - This allows you to handle errors locally and prevent them from propagating to the main program.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Exception Handling in Threading:\n",
        "#    -  When using threads, you can use the `threading.excepthook` to handle uncaught exceptions in threads.\n",
        "#    - This helps you monitor and log errors that occur within threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Exception Handling in Multiprocessing:\n",
        "#    -  In multiprocessing, you can use `multiprocessing.Process.join()` to handle exceptions that occur in child processes.\n",
        "#    - You can also use queues to communicate exceptions between processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Custom Exception Classes:\n",
        "#    -  Define custom exception classes to represent specific error conditions in your concurrent program.\n",
        "#    - This helps you categorize and handle different types of errors more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Logging and Monitoring:\n",
        "#    -  Use logging mechanisms to record exceptions and other events in your concurrent program.\n",
